Shipyard 3D Model Viewer
An interactive 3D model viewer for shipyard engineering projects, built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and the Google <model-viewer> component.

This project was developed as a final assignment for the [Your Institute's Name Here] institute. It serves as a proof-of-concept for a modern, web-based tool to visualize and inspect complex 3D engineering models, providing a foundational step towards digital twin applications in the naval industry.


✨ Key Features
Dynamic Model Catalogue: Loads and displays a list of available 3D models from a JSON data source.

Interactive 3D Viewer: Provides smooth, intuitive controls for model inspection, including orbit, pan, and zoom.

Hierarchical Tree View: Renders the model's complete component structure in a nested, collapsible tree, mirroring the source file's scene graph.

Component Isolation & Visibility Toggle: Allows users to show or hide individual components and entire sub-assemblies directly from the tree view, making it easy to inspect complex interiors.

TypeScript Integration: The entire codebase is strictly typed, ensuring code quality, reliability, and an improved developer experience.

Reactive Logic with Composables: Encapsulates reusable logic, such as the poster generation for 3D models, into clean and maintainable Vue Composables.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: Vue 3 (using Composition API with <script setup>)

Language: TypeScript

Build Tool: Vite

3D Rendering: Google <model-viewer> Web Component

Core 3D Library: Three.js (as a dependency of <model-viewer>)

UI Framework (Optional): Vuetify for UI components like cards and dialogs.

Code Linting: ESLint

Code Formatting: Prettier

📂 Project Structure
The project follows a feature-oriented and scalable folder structure to ensure a clear separation of concerns.
